VERSION="3.9"

# Changelog

## [v3.9] - 2026-06-29
### Fixed
- **Server Name Display (Critical)**: Fixed bug where the panel would always display "openvpn" as the server name. Added a dedicated `display_name` column so you can customize your node name in the Wizard or Preferences, while keeping the internal protocol identifiers correct.
- **WireGuard / OpenVPN Stuck on "Not Installed"**: Fixed bug where running an install directly from the WireGuard or OpenVPN tabs wouldn't properly update the database's `is_installed` status, leaving you stuck on the "Not Installed" page even after a successful install.

## [v3.8] - 2026-06-28
### Fixed
- **WireGuard Panel (Critical)**: Fixed `Internal Server Error` caused by calling `get_db_connection()` which doesn't exist — all calls now correctly use `get_db()`.
- **OpenVPN Install (Critical)**: Same undefined function fix for the `/api/openvpn_stream` and `/api/add_wg_user` routes.
- **OpenVPN & WireGuard "Not Installed" UI**: Completely redesigned to match the WARP page — full-width card with persistent, large terminal always visible on screen. Terminal shows live log as soon as you click Install.
- **Auto-resume polling**: If you navigate away and come back while an install is running, the terminal will automatically resume showing the live log.

## [v3.7] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **Wizard Redesign**: The deployment wizard has been completely redesigned. It now features sleek collapsible boxes for OpenVPN, WireGuard, and WARP, with modern toggle switches (defaulting to OFF).
- **Modular OpenVPN**: OpenVPN is no longer forced to install during the initial setup wizard. It can be skipped and installed later directly from the Web Panel, matching the behavior of WireGuard and WARP.

## [v3.6] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **WireGuard Protocol**: Added full support for WireGuard.
  - **CLI Menu**: Manage WireGuard installation, port selection, and users via `bfp`.
  - **Web Panel**: A new dedicated WireGuard tab featuring installation streams, custom port selection, user management, `.conf` downloads, and live QR code generation for mobile devices.

## [v3.5] - 2026-06-28
### Fixed
- **System Packages**: Docker Engine and Docker Compose are now correctly installed via the "Install Missing" button. Previously, it skipped the Docker repository setup.
- **Terminal Formatting**: The system update and package installation terminal logs now perfectly mirror the CLI menu's exact text layout and hide raw `apt` output during package installation.

## [v3.4] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **ANSI Color Rendering**: All terminal outputs (System Tools, WARP, Backup) now render colored output identical to the CLI menu — bold blue headers, green checkmarks, red errors.
- **Auto-scroll Toggle**: Every terminal in the panel now has a green toggle switch. When ON, the terminal auto-scrolls to the newest line. When OFF, you can freely scroll to read previous output without being interrupted.
- **Styled Scrollbar**: All terminals now have a thin, dark-styled scrollbar that is always visible.
- **`install_packages` action**: System Packages tab now installs all missing packages via the live terminal.

## [v3.3] - 2026-06-28
### Changed
- **System Tools**: Redesigned page with tabs (Update System, System Packages, SSH Settings). Each tab has its own context and the permanent terminal is present in applicable tabs.
- **Backup/Restore**: Moved from System Tools to a dedicated tab inside Preferences.
- **SSH Settings**: Added toggle switches for Password Auth and Pubkey Auth directly from the web panel.
- **Terminal Command**: Renamed the CLI shortcut from `bf-ui` to `bfp` for faster access.

## [v3.2] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **System Tools (Phase 1)**: Migrated 'Essentials' and 'Backup/Restore' from the CLI to a new dedicated Web Panel tab.
- **Backup Vault**: Users can now create, restore, download, and delete full system backups directly from the web interface.
- **Permanent System Terminal**: Added a permanently visible background terminal to execute system updates and restorations in real-time.

## [v3.1] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **WARP Persistent Terminal**: The WARP installation process now runs in a background thread and logs to `/tmp/warp_install.log`. The frontend uses a collapsible terminal that resumes polling even after a page reload.
### Changed
- **OpenVPN UI Tweaks**: Removed literal placeholders from the Add User form, shortened 'Max Users', and simplified table headers.
- **WARP IP Logic**: Applied Single Green Circle rule: True Server IP gets green when OFF, WARP IP gets green when ON. Inactive WARP IP displays as `Offline`.

## [v3.0] - 2026-06-27
### Fixed
- **OpenVPN Layout Typo**: Corrected 'Sim...Users:' summary text to display 'Simultaneous Users:'.
- **WARP UI States**: Fixed the active/inactive circle colors and conditional rendering. True Server IPs now properly always display as active (green). Uninstalled WARP now displays a clean placeholder instead of unmasked IPs.
- **Engine Controls Theme**: Manually mapped the Start/Stop buttons to perfectly match the requested light-pastel mockup styling, overriding global dark mode.

## [v2.9] - 2026-06-27
### Fixed
- **Version Display Bug**: Fixed path resolution in `app.py` so the About tab dynamically reads the current version.
### Changed
- **WARP UI**: Realigned True Server IP and WARP IP with perfectly centered text and right-aligned status circles. Removed top color bars.
- **OpenVPN UI**: Redesigned structure based on user mockup (Settings banner, inline "Add User" horizontal form, and dark-theme clients table).

## [v2.8] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- `.agents` directory to `.gitignore` to prevent leaking local AI context.

## [v2.7] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- **UI Overhaul**: Complete UI overhaul for WARP, OpenVPN, and Preferences tabs.
- **Server Configuration**: Added Server Name configuration in Preferences.

## [v2.6] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- **Unified Preferences Page**: Combined Settings and Logs into a unified 'Preferences' page with an 'About' tab.
- **Centralized Versioning**: Project version is now centrally defined in `CHANGELOG.md` and read by all Bash and Python scripts.
- **`.gitignore`**: Added strict ignoring for `panel.db`, log files, and Python cache.
- **CLI Logging Enhancement**: All main CLI scripts now output the Toolkit version dynamically on launch.

### Changed
- **Web Panel Sidebar**: Removed categorized groupings and renamed the header to a stylized 'BF Panel'.
- **Panel CLI Menu**: Removed redundant 'View Installation Logs' option to centralize all logging to the unified Log Center.

## [v2.5] - 2026-06-25
### Added
- **Hybrid Log Center**: Introduced a comprehensive centralized logging system supporting 9 different log feeds.
- **Unified Master Stream**: Added a new chronological interleaved log feed covering Web Panel, OpenVPN, and WARP outputs.
- **Backup & Restore Module**: Integrated a new module for archiving and restoring VPN configs and Web Panel database.

### Changed
- **CLI Sub-menus**: Removed redundant log viewing options from OpenVPN, WARP, and Web Panel modules, deferring logging to the new Log Center.
- **CLI Main Menu**: Reordered items logically according to importance (Web Panel, OpenVPN, WARP, Essentials, Backup/Restore, Logs).
- **Web Panel Dashboard**: Integrated Chart.js for real-time network traffic visualization.
- **Web Panel Sidebar**: Grouped items logically under 'Overview', 'Network Services', and 'Administration'.
- **Web Panel OpenVPN UI**: Relocated the user provisioning form into a sleek Floating Action Button (FAB) and modal.
- **Web Panel Logs UI**: Replaced horizontal tabs with a modern dropdown selector.

### Security
- **Subprocess Hardening**: Migrated user script executions in `app.py` from `os.system` to `subprocess.run` to mitigate shell injection.
- **Input Sanitization**: Implemented strict stripping of newlines and quotes for DNS input fields to prevent config corruption.
- **Exception Handling**: Improved `get_traffic()` to gracefully catch `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`.
